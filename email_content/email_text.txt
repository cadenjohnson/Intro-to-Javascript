Ingredients

1 1/2 pounds salmon fillet (preferably wild caught for best flavor)
1/4 cup low-sodium soy sauce (or certified gluten free Tamari if you eat gluten free)
1/4 cup lightly packed brown sugar
1 teaspoon lemon zest
1 Tablespoon freshly squeezed lemon juice
4 medium cloves garlic (minced by hand - don’t use a garlic press)
2 Tablespoons unsalted butter
1 Tablespoon Dijon mustard
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
1/4 teaspoon freshly cracked black pepper
1 Tablespoon finely chopped fresh parsley (for serving)

Instructions

Let the salmon sit at room temperature for 10 minutes before you bake it.
Position the rack in the center of the oven and preheat it to 375 F (190 C).
To a small saucepan over medium heat, add the soy sauce, brown sugar, lemon zest, lemon juice, and garlic.
Allow the mixture to cook until the sugar has melted, the liquid has reduced by half, and it’s made a sticky glaze.
Add half of the butter and swirl until it has melted, remove the pan from the heat, and add in the second half of the butter.
Swirl until the remaining butter has melted from the residual heat. Add in the Dijon mustard and stir to combine.
Cover a rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil (you need enough that you’ll be able to fold the edges over and create a tight seal).
Place the salmon skin side down in the center of the foil, then sprinkle with salt and pepper.
Pour the soy sauce mixture over the salmon, and seal the aluminum foil.
Bake for 15 - 18 minutes, or until the salmon is nearly cooked through.
Open the foil pack, turn the oven to broil, and broil for 2 minutes (or until the top has golden edges and is crispy - keep a close eye on it so it doesn’t burn).
Sprinkle with fresh diced parsley, and serve hot.

Notes
Use your best judgement with the amount of time that you bake your salmon.
If you have an exceptionally thin piece, start checking it after 10 minutes.
If you have a very thick piece, you’ll likely need 20 - 25 minutes before you broil it.
